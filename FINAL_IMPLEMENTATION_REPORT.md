## ‚≠ê NEW Features Implemented (Last Session)

### 1. Multi-Depot Support

**What**: Vehicles can be assigned to different home depots, enabling distributed logistics operations.

**Implementation**:
- Extended `Vehicle` model with `depotId` field
- Added `loadDepots()` method to `JsonDataLoader` (supports `depots.json` or fallback to `depot.json`)
- Updated `MasterRoutingAgent` to use depot map
- Modified `DeliveryAgent` to use vehicle-specific depot
- `RouteHeuristics` now uses vehicle's assigned depot for route start/end

**Files Modified**:
- `Vehicle.java` - Added `depotId` field and getter
- `JsonDataLoader.java` - Added `loadDepots()` method, updated `loadVehicles()` to parse `depotId`
- `MasterRoutingAgent.java` - Uses `depots` map, assigns depot per vehicle
- `DeliveryAgent.java` - Loads vehicle-specific depot on startup

**Usage Example**:
```json
// depots.json (optional, for multi-depot)
[
  {"id": "DEPOT_NORTH", "latitude": 10.8500, "longitude": 106.6800},
  {"id": "DEPOT_SOUTH", "latitude": 10.7500, "longitude": 106.6500}
]

// vehicles.json
[
  {"id": "V1", "capacity": 100, "depotId": "DEPOT_NORTH"},
  {"id": "V2", "capacity": 150, "depotId": "DEPOT_SOUTH"}
]
```

**Benefits**:
- Supports regional distribution centers
- Reduces deadheading (empty travel)
- More realistic for large-scale logistics

---

### 2. Dynamic Replan on Delays/Breakdowns

**What**: When a vehicle fails or is delayed, the system automatically reassigns affected orders to other vehicles via emergency negotiation.

**Implementation**:
- Added `handleVehicleFailure()` in `MasterRoutingAgent` to process `DELAY`/`BREAKDOWN` messages
- Parses affected order IDs from message content
- Removes affected orders from `awardedOrderIds` lock (allows reassignment)
- Initiates emergency CNP negotiation for each affected order
- Added `simulateBreakdown()` in `DeliveryAgent` for testing (responds to `SIMULATE_BREAKDOWN` message)

**Files Modified**:
- `MasterRoutingAgent.java` - Added `DELAY`/`BREAKDOWN` ontology handling and `handleVehicleFailure()` method
- `DeliveryAgent.java` - Added `simulateBreakdown()` method and `SIMULATE_BREAKDOWN` handler

**Usage Example**:
```java
// DeliveryAgent sends BREAKDOWN message
ACLMessage msg = new ACLMessage(ACLMessage.INFORM);
msg.setOntology("BREAKDOWN");
msg.setContent("C5,C6,C7");  // Affected order IDs
msg.addReceiver(new AID("MRA", AID.ISLOCALNAME));
send(msg);
```

**Flow**:
1. Vehicle (DeliveryAgent) detects failure ‚Üí sends BREAKDOWN message to MRA
2. MRA receives message ‚Üí parses affected order IDs
3. MRA removes orders from `awardedOrderIds` (unlocks them)
4. MRA broadcasts CFP for each affected order
5. Other vehicles bid on the orders
6. MRA awards to best bidders
7. Affected orders reassigned without full replan

**Benefits**:
- Fast recovery from failures
- Minimal disruption (only affected orders renegotiated)
- Realistic emergency handling

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Multi-Depot: Depot-aware routing

DeliveryAgent (DA-V1, DA-V2, ...)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CFP Response: Compute incremental cost
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Award Acceptance: Append order to route
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Breakdown Reporting: Send affected orders to MRA
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Depot-Specific: Start/end at assigned depot

TrafficPredictAgent
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Traffic Simulation: Broadcast zone multipliers (15s interval)
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Startup:
   MRA loads depots, vehicles, orders
   ‚Üí Choco assigns orders to vehicles (capacity + time feasible)
   ‚Üí TW-insertion sequences orders per vehicle
   ‚Üí 2-opt improves routes
   ‚Üí Dispatch routes to DeliveryAgents

2. New Order Arrival:
   MRA receives NEW_ORDER
   ‚Üí Broadcasts CFP to all DeliveryAgents
   ‚Üí Collects proposals (2s deadline)
   ‚Üí Awards to lowest-cost bidder
   ‚Üí Winner appends order to route

3. Traffic Update:
   TrafficPredictAgent sends TRAFFIC_UPDATE
   ‚Üí MRA updates TrafficModel
   ‚Üí If >10s since last replan ‚Üí full replan
   ‚Üí Dispatches updated routes

4. Vehicle Breakdown:
   DeliveryAgent sends BREAKDOWN (affected order IDs)
   ‚Üí MRA unlocks affected orders
   ‚Üí Initiates emergency CNP for each
   ‚Üí Other vehicles bid
   ‚Üí Orders reassigned without full replan

## üöÄ How to Test New Features

### Test Multi-Depot
1. Create `src/main/resources/data/depots.json`:
```json
[
  {"id": "DEPOT_A", "latitude": 10.7800, "longitude": 106.6700},
  {"id": "DEPOT_B", "latitude": 10.8400, "longitude": 106.6300}
]
```

2. Update `vehicles.json` to assign depots:
```json
[
  {"id": "V1", "capacity": 100, "depotId": "DEPOT_A"},
  {"id": "V2", "capacity": 120, "depotId": "DEPOT_B"}
]
```

3. Run and observe: `DeliveryAgent V1 online for vehicle V1 at depot DEPOT_A`

### Test Breakdown Handling
1. Start the system
2. Send a breakdown message to a DeliveryAgent (via JADE GUI or programmatically):
```
Ontology: SIMULATE_BREAKDOWN
Receiver: DA-V1
```

3. Observe logs:
   - DA-V1: `simulated BREAKDOWN. Reported X affected orders`
   - MRA: `Vehicle V1 reported BREAKDOWN`
   - MRA: `Reassigning X affected orders`
   - MRA: `Initiating emergency reassignment for order ...`
   - MRA: `Awarded order X to DA-V2`

| Breakdown Recovery | Manual intervention | Auto-reassignment (1-2s) | **‚àû improvement** |
| Multi-Region Support | Single depot only | Multi-depot | **Enabled** |
