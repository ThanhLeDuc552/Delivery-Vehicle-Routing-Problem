checklist (backend):
- have the agents work completely independent of eachother (only find out each other through the df of jade)
- have the path finding algorithm completely manual ?
- have the agents behave as expected (vehicle receiving routes, customer notified by vehicles & request packages, depot handle requests & hand over routes for the vehicle to pick )
- have the code been properly cleaned, commented ?
- have the sample scenario been put to a txt file instead of if/else clause in the code ?
- have oop principles been followed ?
- have the extensions been implemented ?
