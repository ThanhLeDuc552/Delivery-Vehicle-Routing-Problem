# Test Case: Basic Requirement 2 - Maximum Distance Constraint

## Objective
Verify that each vehicle respects its maximum distance constraint (dv).

## Test Scenario
- **Vehicles:**
  - Vehicle1: Capacity 50, MaxDistance 500.0
  - Vehicle2: Capacity 40, MaxDistance 400.0
  - Vehicle3: Capacity 30, MaxDistance 300.0
- **Customers:** 10 customers with varying distances from depot
- **Expected Behavior:** No vehicle should be assigned a route that exceeds its maximum distance.

## Test Steps
1. Start the system with vehicles having different max distances
2. Create customer requests that would require long routes
3. Wait for batch processing
4. Observe route assignments and distance calculations

## Expected Results
- Each vehicle's route distance should be ≤ vehicle's maxDistance
- Vehicles should refuse routes that exceed their maxDistance during bidding
- Solver should enforce maximum distance constraint per vehicle
- Console output should show: `Distance: X.XX/MAX_DISTANCE`

## Verification
- Check vehicle bidding logs for distance constraint checks
- Verify solver output shows routes within distance limits
- Confirm that vehicles refuse routes exceeding maxDistance
- Check that total route distance (including travel to/from depot) ≤ maxDistance

## Example Output
```
Vehicle Vehicle1: Route exceeds maximum distance (550.25 > 500.0)
Vehicle Vehicle1: Refusing route: exceeds maximum distance

Vehicle 1: [1,2,3] | Items: 30/50 | Distance: 450.00/500.00
Vehicle 2: [4,5,6] | Items: 25/40 | Distance: 380.50/400.00
Vehicle 3: [7,8] | Items: 20/30 | Distance: 280.75/300.00
```

## Edge Cases
- Route distance exactly at maxDistance (should be accepted)
- Route distance slightly over maxDistance (should be refused)
- Multiple vehicles with different maxDistances
- Routes that would be feasible if maxDistance was higher

## Notes
- Maximum distance includes: travel to first customer + route distance + return to depot
- Vehicle agents check distance constraint during bidding phase
- Solver enforces distance constraint during optimization
