work to do:
- backend:
    - process 3-type of data: vehicle-only, customer-only, and vehicle-customer

- agent:
    - da:
        - if mra trying to query when some das are delivering, they may response busy (bring back the state)
        - states are busy and free (busy when delivering, free when at/arrived back to the depot position)
    - main:
        - based on the type of data from api to terminate, start, or do nothing to the agents
    - about the log:
        - handle the log more to have more conversation between the agents

        - simplify (or beautify) the log, show it on the UI (show everything on the UI)

    - about the agents:
        - handle edge cases (consecutive requests when the das are delivering, vehicle state (bring back the free/busy) to occupy the log more)

- frontend:
    - the vehicle page should send separate information
    - requests (that is not loaded from the test cases) should not contain vehicle information anymore
    - requests from test case however, will still include vehicle (for demonstration)
    - the vehicle page should have a save button, and if changes happen then force the user to save changes before exit the page
    - saving changes will send vehicles data to the api (with the same format as the current vehicle data)

- split the prj into multiple test cases (!w max distance, /w max distance, /w time window, /w bidding (if possible))
- all the scenarios, logs must be described as detailed as possible in the report as well as the video & presentation
- practice presenting for the final w
- must done within this week !!!
- have a complete scenario & overall workflow diagram
- report
