THIS IS CVRP

agents:

- agent requirement:
	- mra and da (master routing agent & delivery agent)
	- must register their services to jade's yellow page (agents is implemented using jade)
	- must find each other through the type of service (no hard code name)
	- initiated using a configuration file (the main will read that file and start the agents)
	- proper communication protocol must be used (FIPA)
	- proper logs must be extracted to show the detailed communication process of the agents
	- Protocol choice: Use FIPA-Request or FIPA-Contract-Net for negotiation/requests. Contract-Net is nice if you want DAs to bid for routes/items in an extension. Use Request for simple queries/answers.

	- Logging level: Save both message-level logs (sender, receiver, performative, content, timestamp) and result logs (routes assigned, route distance, items delivered).

	- Output format: Put final results in JSON and also produce a human-readable summary in the GUI / console.

- mra:
	- have its own location (act as the depot where all da's start from and travel back to)
	- read the problem passed by the main (about the "customers" it need to deliver package to)
	- ask for the vehicle's information, combine with the customer information to solve routes
	- assign routes back to the das to deliver

- da:
	- have its own capacity & maximum travel distance
	- answer to the mra


about the problem:
	- it is cvrp
	- the customer list will:
		- contain customers' id (node id), demand (number of item), and coordinates
	- the solution must work when the total demand is larger than total vehicle capacity 
		- optimal solution is to deliver the most package with the least distance
		- prefer number of package delivered over minimizing distance
	- use google-or tool as the main solver

more:
	- generate several configuration files to test the system (edge cases where demand exceed capacity as well)
	- log the output as json, put in txt files 

5) Suggested set of config / test-case files to generate

case_small.json — few customers, capacity >= demand (sanity).

case_capacity_shortfall.json — total demand > total capacity (edge case).

case_tight_distance.json — vehicles have tight max_distance making some customers unreachable.

case_many_customers.json — stress test (performance).

case_random_seeded.json — for reproducibility.
