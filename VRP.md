# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) â€” Extremely Detailed List of Requirements

## General Objective
- Determine the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve a set of customer locations.
- Optimize for minimum total transportation cost, distance, time, or resource usage.
- Plan assignments of goods, quantities, and routes for each vehicle so that all customer demands are met without exceeding vehicle limitations.

## Stakeholders and Use Cases
- Retailers, distributors, manufacturers: those who need transportation and delivery of products.
- Fleet owners and vehicle operators: responsible for vehicle assignment, scheduling, and operational costs.
- Logistics service providers (e.g. 3PL companies): handle the integration and optimization of multi-party delivery networks.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP)
- Vehicles may depart from and return to multiple depot sites.
- Loading/unloading constraints at depots, such as:
  - Limited number of bays available for simultaneous operations.
  - Vehicles must wait if bays are occupied, causing staggered departures and arrivals.
- Maintain depot capacity records, scheduling, and queue management for vehicle service.

### 2. Multi-Commodity VRP
- Vehicles must transport different types of goods, possibly with restrictions on mixing (e.g. incompatibility between food and chemicals).
- Maintain detailed item catalog with attributes: type, size, stackability, safety constraints.
- Route planning must respect:
  - Separation of incompatible goods.
  - Priority/shipping order for goods requiring temperature control or special handling.
- Manage loading patterns based on dimensions and allowed combinations.

### 3. Vehicle Routing with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD)
- Some locations require pickup of goods, others require deliveries, some may require both.
- Track individual pickup and delivery requests by location and required service time.
- Vehicles have finite capacity; all pickups and deliveries must fit within their operational limits at all times.
- Design routes so that item transfers respect origin-destination chains for each cargo (never transfer items to wrong destination).
- Vehicles must avoid exceeding capacity at any point during their route.

### 4. Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)
- Each vehicle is assigned a maximum load, defined in physical dimensions (weight, volume).
- Customer demands are specified in compatible units; vehicles cannot exceed their defined limits.
- Route and load planning must:
  - Track available capacity per vehicle at every stop.
  - Prevent overloading, even if demand appears small in aggregation.
  - Include reassignments if initial allocation fails due to capacity violation.
- Real-time reallocation required if on-route measurements suggest possible overload.

### 5. VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW)
- Each customer/location defines a service time interval (earliest/latest arrival).
- Vehicles must schedule their arrivals and departures to respect these time windows.
- Route planning must consider:
  - Travel times between locations and possible delays.
  - Waiting periods if vehicles arrive early.
  - Skip or re-route opportunities if time windows are missed.
- Time windows may overlap or conflict, requiring prioritization or dynamic scheduling.

### 6. Inventory Routing Problem (IRP)
- Delivery planning must coordinate inventory levels at customer sites with replenishment needs.
- Each customer may have daily/week demand, minimum/maximum allowed inventory.
- Vehicle routes must ensure no overstock or understock occurs, balancing shipments across the vehicle fleet.
- Decisions include:
  - When and how much to deliver to each customer.
  - Sequence of deliveries to minimize distance while meeting replenishment requirements.
- Track real-time inventory status updates and adjust routes dynamically.

### 7. Stochastic VRP (SVRP)
- Customer demands are random variables, not fixed amounts.
- Vehicle routes must be robust against fluctuations in delivered quantities.
- Plan for contingencies:
  - Possible mid-route restocking or returns to depot.
  - Spare capacity allocation to handle unexpected high demand.
  - Emergency deliveries or pickups.
- Stochastic models used to estimate probabilities and inform risk management in routing.

### 8. Dynamic VRP
- New orders appear during the course of the day/route.
- Routes and schedules must be able to be updated in real-time.
- Vehicles may be reassigned, redirected or reprioritized according to latest information.
- Requires continuous monitoring of fleet locations, customer requests, and traffic conditions.
- Implement dynamic optimization algorithms and mobile communication with drivers.

### 9. VRP with Backhaul (VRPB)
- Certain routes require vehicles to pick up goods on the return leg after making initial deliveries.
- Each customer may have goods to deliver to depot or another site.
- Routes planned so backhaul operations are efficient and do not waste capacity.
- Vehicles may travel empty for a portion of their route to position for backhaul.
- Careful scheduling required to match delivery and backhaul needs without conflicts.

### 10. Additional Real-World Constraints
- Dock hours: Only certain times available for vehicle loading/unloading.
- Diverse vehicle types: Trailers, vans, refrigerated trucks, etc., with unique operational limits.
- Driver shifts, rest time, experience, and preferences (legal and practical limitations).
- Traffic schedules: Must factor in rush hour, expected delays, and current traffic events.
- Vehicle constraints: Fuel stops, maintenance needs, and breakdown recovery plans.
- Routing interruptions: Customs, delivery paperwork, unexpected penalties, or wait times.
- Environmental restrictions: Emissions regulations, noise ordinances, and weather impact.
- Security and safety: Special treatment for high-value or hazardous materials.
- Customer-specific requirements: Delivery instructions, site access restrictions, required equipment.
- Reporting and auditing: Track every route, delivery, and exception for compliance and continuous improvement.

## Performance Metrics
- Total route distance/time/cost.
- On-time delivery rate (percent of deliveries within time windows).
- Fleet utilization efficiency.
- Inventory level deviations from targets.
- Response time to new/dynamic orders.
- Number and length of vehicle idle/wait periods.
- Operational cost per delivery/per kilometer.

## Data and Integration Needs
- GIS/mapping data for precise routing.
- Real-time traffic and weather feeds.
- Vehicle telematics for live tracking.
- Warehouse and inventory management systems integration.
- Order management and customer service platforms.

## Optimization Tools and Methods
- Heuristic algorithms: Savings, sweep, nearest neighbor, etc.
- Metaheuristics: Genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization.
- Exact methods: Mixed integer programming, constraint programming.
- Software integration: ERP, TMS, fleet management solutions.
- Real-time dashboards and route adjustment tools.
