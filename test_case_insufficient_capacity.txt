# Test Case: Insufficient Total Capacity

## Objective
Verify that the system handles cases where total vehicle capacity is less than total items requested.

## Test Scenario
- **Total Items Requested:** 150 items
- **Total Vehicle Capacity:** 120 items (50 + 40 + 30)
- **Vehicles:**
  - Vehicle1: Capacity 50, MaxDistance 1000
  - Vehicle2: Capacity 40, MaxDistance 800
  - Vehicle3: Capacity 30, MaxDistance 600
- **Expected Behavior:** System should deliver maximum possible items (120 items) and handle undelivered items appropriately.

## Test Steps
1. Start the system
2. Create customer requests totaling 150 items
3. Wait for batch processing
4. Observe which items are delivered and which are not

## Expected Results
- System should deliver 120 items (maximum possible)
- 30 items should remain undelivered (queued for next batch or rejected)
- Solution should prioritize items delivered (120) over distance minimization
- All vehicle capacity should be utilized

## Verification
- Check console output for: "Items delivered: 120/150"
- Verify that all vehicles are at capacity
- Confirm that some customers did not receive delivery
- Check that system handles undelivered items (queued or notified)

## Example Output
```
=== Solution Summary ===
Total items delivered: 120/150
Total distance: 1850.75
Number of routes: 3
Vehicle 1: [1,2,3,4,5] | Items: 50/50 | Distance: 650.25/1000.00
Vehicle 2: [6,7,8,9] | Items: 40/40 | Distance: 600.50/800.00
Vehicle 3: [10,11,12] | Items: 30/30 | Distance: 600.00/600.00

Depot: 30 items remain undelivered (queued for next batch)
```

## Notes
- Basic Requirement 1 states: "You cannot assume that the total capacity of all vehicles is equal or more than the number of items to be delivered"
- System must work when total capacity < total items
- Undelivered items should be handled (queued, prioritized, or customer notified)
