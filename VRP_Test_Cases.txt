Test case 1:

- Depot: Main routing agent (receive packages from the customer)
- Vehicle: Delivery agent (notify the MRA if free, receive packages then deliver)

workflow:
    - depot receive data from UI => notify the Delivery agent (direct communication)
    - delivery generate vehicles (different agents), each has a random state, which then notify back to the depot
    - after collecting the vehicle num, start the calculating process
    - after done processing, release routes => vehicle will compete for the shortest route

not make sense:
    - generate vehicle based on user req
        => should have 2 separate pages, 1 for vehicle defining, 1 for customer req (kind of a manage page for a company)
        

Fix: 
- combine mra & Depot

- delivery agent:
    - state: free / occupied (random, simulate real-world situation)
    - capacity
    - the number of vehicles will be determined by the user (on the web)
    - the route from MRA
