# üöö COS30018 ‚Äì Vehicle Routing Problem Project Workflow (Full Plan)

**Duration:** 6 Weeks (‚âà 1.5 Months)
**Team Size:** 2 Members (Optimization Lead & System/GUI Engineer)
**Due Date:** 27 October 2024

---

## üìò Project Summary

You will implement and demonstrate a **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** solution for a courier company using **multi-agent architecture** and **search/optimization algorithms**.

---

## üö´ Prohibited Elements

- ‚ùå You **cannot rely solely on existing solvers** such as Google OR-Tools or OptaPlanner.You **must implement your own optimization/search algorithm** (e.g., GA, ACO, PSO, or CSP).
- ‚ùå Poor coding practice (unstructured code or no comments) ‚Üí **Up to -20 marks penalty**.
- ‚ùå Not showing weekly progress ‚Üí **Up to -50 marks penalty**.
- ‚ùå Late submission: **-10% per day**, **0% after 5 days**.

## üèÜ Requirements for D/HD (Distinction/High Distinction)

To achieve a D/HD, the project must demonstrate:

1. ‚úÖ **Core Functionality**

   - Complete **Tasks 1‚Äì3** (interaction, optimization, and constraints).
   - Proper **communication protocol** between MRA and DAs with a sequence diagram.
2. ‚úÖ **Optimization Logic**

   - Use an implemented optimization algorithm to generate **optimal route assignments** under capacity and distance constraints.
3. ‚úÖ **GUI and Visualization**

   - Functional GUI showing routes, costs, and delivery visualization.
4. ‚úÖ **Research Extension (20%)**

   - Implement **Extension Option 1:** VRP with Time Windows, or
   - Implement **Extension Option 2:** Bidding System (Amazon-Uber style).
5. ‚úÖ **Documentation & Presentation**

   - 8‚Äì10 page project report (architecture, algorithms, analysis).
   - 6‚Äì8 minute presentation video.
   - Demonstrated weekly progress and teamwork evidence.

---

## üí° Guidance

- You may reference **Google OR-Tools** or **OptaPlanner** as baseline tests, but not as your main implementation.
- Use clear **sequence diagrams** for inter-agent communication.
- Demonstrate strong **team collaboration** and **version control** through Git (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
- Follow good software engineering practices (clear architecture, modular design, meaningful comments).
