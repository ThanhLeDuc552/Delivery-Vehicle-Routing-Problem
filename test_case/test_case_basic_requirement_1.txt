# Test Case: Basic Requirement 1 - Prioritize Items Delivered Over Distance

## Objective
Verify that the system prioritizes the number of items delivered over total travel distance.

## Test Scenario
- **Total Items Requested:** 100 items
- **Total Vehicle Capacity:** 80 items (insufficient to deliver all items)
- **Vehicles:**
  - Vehicle1: Capacity 50, MaxDistance 1000
  - Vehicle2: Capacity 30, MaxDistance 800
- **Expected Behavior:** System should deliver as many items as possible (up to 80 items), even if it results in a longer total distance.

## Test Steps
1. Start the system with Main.java
2. Create customer requests totaling 100 items
3. Wait for batch processing (batch threshold = 5 requests)
4. Observe solver output

## Expected Results
- Solver should deliver 80 items (maximum possible given vehicle capacities)
- Solution should show: `Items delivered: 80/100`
- Total distance should be minimized as secondary objective
- Some customers may not receive delivery due to capacity constraints

## Verification
- Check console output for: "Items delivered: X/100" where X should be maximized
- Verify that all vehicle capacity is utilized
- Confirm that solution prioritizes items delivered over distance minimization

## Example Output
```
=== Solution Summary ===
Total items delivered: 80/100
Total distance: 1250.50
Number of routes: 2
Vehicle 1: [1,2,3,4,5] | Items: 50/50 | Distance: 750.25/1000.00
Vehicle 2: [6,7,8,9] | Items: 30/30 | Distance: 500.25/800.00
```

## Notes
- If total capacity < total items, not all items can be delivered
- System should maximize items delivered first, then minimize distance
- Unvisited nodes will have penalty applied (handled by OR-Tools disjunction)
