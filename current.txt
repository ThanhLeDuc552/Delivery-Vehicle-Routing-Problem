- get rid of all api requests, all frontend relations
- implement customer agent
	- send request to the depot
	- request contain name & quantity of the item

- depot agent:
	- now handle both calculation, item query (if the item is available then account for the calculation of route, else send messages back to the customer to inform them about the state of the item)
	- handle the calculation

- vehicle agent:
	- now become an independent agent, no need the use of delivery agent
	- will bid for the routes handed out by the depot agent
	- not always start at the depot, must account for real-life factor (from somewhere and heading back to the depot) (this will affect the bid)

- others:
	- remove the delivery agent completely
	- make sure everything follows oop principle
	- all communications must follow fipa protocol, using jade as the main platform, and or-tool as the main solver
	- make sure the solver in a separate class so that it can be changed to another solver in the future


- the item system should be a simple dictionary by now, no need for a complex MySQL system
- make sure to generate a complete readme file about the project structure, the agents, agent role, workflow, usage, and test cases to be verified
- the agents must register their services on the yellow page of jade so that they can automatically discover each other
- change the depot back to 0 0, generate test cases, make sure the main file only start the agents, and no agents depend on each other

- make the vehicle start as free, absent when delivering, free again when finished deliver to the last customer of the route
- i dont see the customer being informed when the good arrived
- increase the sleeping time between each customer request

- the customer should be informed about their package arrival by the vehicle agent that take care of the corresponding route


current bidding system:
- need to make the bidding more clear
- need to include a complete scenario in the report
-
